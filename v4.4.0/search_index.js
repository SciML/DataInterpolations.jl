B-splines are a global method, meaning that every data point is taken into account for each point of the curve. The interpolating B-spline is the version which hits each of the points. This method is described in more detail here. Let's plot a cubic B-spline (3rd order).

It again is a global method. In this case, we need to give a number of control points length(t)>h and this method fits a B-spline through the control points which is a least square approximation. This has a natural effect of smoothing the data.

We will demonstrate the curve fit on the dense data since we generated it based on sin(t), so this is the curve we want to fit through it. Do do so, let's define a similar function with parameters.
